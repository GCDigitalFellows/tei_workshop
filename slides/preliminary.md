# Preliminary Questions for Project Analysis

Before begining any encoding project, it's important to take some time to think through your goals for the project, and weigh them against an analysis of the document itself. The strength of TEI lies in its robustness and potential for customization, so its users need to be extremely aware of their document's key features and other features that they want the TEI to capture. They need to consider the document or collection of documents, their audience, their research goals, and how they wish to represent textual data. Such questions will help indicate what needs to be encoded and how it will be encoded. 

There are many directions that a TEI project might take. The WWP indicates an array of such potential directions: 

>A collection focusing on an author whose writings are an important source of information about famous contemporaries might usefully encode all references to names and works, perhaps including links to more detailed indexes of biographical or critical information. Similarly, an electronic edition of a particular author or work might well include a representation of variant readings, authorial revisions, editorial emendations, and similar editorial information. Some collections of this sort are intended to serve very specific research goals, such as linguistic analysis, or to serve as the basis for a dictionary, and in these cases the markup may be very highly specialized.

Below are some questions, provided by the WWP, for preliminary document and project analysis. 

1. What is the purpose of the project (e.g. preservation, research, dissemination)?
2. How is    the document structured? How will you encode the major structural chunks in your document?
3. Are there any kinds of regularization or editorial amendment you will perform as you transcribe the text? What is the rationale for these changes?
4. How much information about the appearance of the document do you need to capture? How will you encode the key features of the document?
5. Are there any features of your document that TEI doesn't appear to support?

In your groups, take a few minutes to review these questions, using the below documents from the *Picture of Dorian Gray* manuscript as a sample source text. How would you approach the encoding of such a text?
