# Getting Started with TEI

TEI (short for [Text Encoding Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative)) is a method for encoding, or marking up, texts in such a way that humans and computers can make sense of them. It is a set of standards for electronic editing that facilitates the digitization and transcription of textual material. Each standard follows certain *guidelines*,developed and maintained by the [TEI Consortium](https://tei-c.org/), which provides extensive recommendations for marking up text. These recommendations mostly consist of rules for using various “tags” to mark up certain textual elements, such as **&lt;p>** for paragraph, **&lt;editor>** for an editorial intervention, or **&lt;del>** to indicate deleted text. 

By using TEI, you can encode a text to represent its structure, appearance, and content in a way that the computer can process. You might use it to mark up manuscripts, poems, prose, drama, and even audio materials. Once a text is marked up with TEI, the relevant elements can be searched, processed, and rendered to facilitate scholarly research. For example, you might provide a diplomatic transcription of a manuscript page, or allow for a full-text search that isolates specific elements like proper names or editorial emendations. Because TEI is built to be customizable, many projects develop their own standards based on one of the existing modules (or "schemas"), tailoring the schema to capture the key features of their source text. 

For today's workshop, we will be delving into the workings of TEI and practice using it hands-on. First, we will examine the guidelines, and then I will demostrate a quick tutorial on how to implement a specific subset of them, using elements from the Primary Source Editing module. For the second half of the workshop, you will get the opportunity to practice TEI by encoding a manuscript page. At the end of the workshop, we will share what we've encoded by rendering our code through oxYgen, an editor that supports TEI.
