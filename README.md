## Workshops
It was first taught at CUNY GC by Filipa Calado in the Spring of 2019 and 2020 and  as a two hour in person workshop.

Abstract: 

> This workshop is a deep introduction to the theory and practice of encoding electronic texts for the humanities. It is designed for students who are interested in the transcription and digitization of manuscripts and print-based texts into diplomatic, digital formats. The workshop contains three parts: first, an overview of TEI and the major schemas; second, a quick introduction and tutorial on one or more applications used for encoding; and finally, for the bulk of the workshop, students will get the opportunity to practice encoding a manuscript page in small groups. Throughout this work, we will discuss common issues with encoding, such as how to tag complex identities and data.

## Requirements
- Participants should have a text editor like VS Code installed on their computers.

## Reception and Feedback
Feedback was very good. Students thought the pace and content was effective. 

## Needed/Desired Changes 
More time to practice hands-on encoding.
